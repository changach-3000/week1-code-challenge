# Week One Code Challenge

This Code challenge comprises of three problems

## Student Grade Generator
Write a program that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Then output the correct grade as follows:
A > 79
B - 60 - 79
C - 49-59
D - 40-49
E < 40

## Speed Detector
Write a program that takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.
